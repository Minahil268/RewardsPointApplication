# Rewards Point Application

This repository contains the source code for a rewards point application. The application allows users to collect points in exchange for completing tasks. These points can be exchanged for rewards such as discounts, free products, and more. 

The project is written in Java and uses the Spring Boot framework. It also makes use of a MySQL database to store points and user data. 

To get started, clone the repository and run `mvn package`. This will compile the code into an executable jar file which you can then run with   `java -jar .\target\RewardsPointApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`. The application will start on port 8080 by default, but this can be changed by editing `application.properties`file under src/main/resources/. 
  Once running, you can open a browser window or Postman app to interact with it via its REST API endpoints (e.g., `/users`). You'll need a valid API key from us to access these endpoints though!  For more information about how to interact with our API, please read our documentation available here: https://github.com/Minahil268/RewardsPointApplication/wiki
